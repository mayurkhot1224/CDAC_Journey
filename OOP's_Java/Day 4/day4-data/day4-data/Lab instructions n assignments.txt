Day 1
0. After the combined lab session ,
please download javadocs
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-doc-downloads.html

1. Go through today's sequence.txt
Revise n brush up on all mentioned concepts.

2. Solve this
5.1 Can you arrange Fruit,Apple,Orange,Mango in inheritance hierarchy ?
Use tight encapsulation.

5.2 Properties (instance variables)  : color : String , weight : double , name:String, fresh : boolean

5.3 Add suitable constructors.

5.4 Override  toString correctly to return state of all fruits (return only  : name ,color , weight )

5.5 Add a taste() method : public String taste()

For Fruit : Can you identify taste of any general fruit ?
So will you add a taste() with this definition : returns "no specific taste" OR can u apply abstraction?

Apple : should return  "sweet n sour"
Mango : should return  "sweet"
Orange : should return  "sour"

5.6 Add specific functionality , in the sub classes
In Mango : public void pulp() {Display name n color of the fruit + a mesg  creating  pulp!}
In Orange : public void juice() {Display name n weight of the fruit + a mesg extracting juice!}
In Apple : public void jam() {Display name of the fruit + a mesg  making jam!}


5.7 Add all of above classes under the package "com.app.fruits"
5.8 Create java application FruitBasket , with main method , as a tester , in com.app.tester package.
5.9 Prompt user for the basket size n create suitable data structure

5.10 Supply options
1. Add Mango
2. Add Orange
3. Add Apple
NOTE : You will be adding a fresh fruit in the basket , in all of above options.

4. Display names of all fruits in the basket.

5. Display name,color,weight , taste of all fresh fruits , in the basket.


6. Mark a fruit in a basket , as stale(=not fresh)
i/p : index 
o/p : error message (in case of invalid index) or mark it stale

7. Mark all sour fruits stale 
Hint : Use equals() method of the String class.

8. Invoke fruit specific functionality (pulp / juice / jam)
i/p : index
Invoke correct functionality (pulp / juice / jam)

10. Exit 


Day 2
In combined lab

1. import day2.1 in your workspace
Refer to "day2-data\day2_help\exception handling\readme.txt"
Revise some of the important code samples.

2. Complete license expiry validation 


3. 
Can you override static methods ? 
Confirm with code example

4. Attach debugger , to confirm the flow of execution.

5. Continue to the individual lab
5.1 Complete revision of exc handling n date time handling

5.2 Complete pending assignment of Day 1



Day 3.

1. import day3.1 n queries eclipse projects ,  in your workspace . Refer to today's readmes n revise
1.1 static methods n overriding
1.2 Attach debuger n check
1.3 Java 8 (modern java) Date time handling
1.4 String , StringBuilder classes 
immutability , == vs equals , literal vs non literal strings

1.5 Wrapper classes n conversions

1.6 Variable args (var-args)


2. After completing earlier work , try this.

 Beginning of a mini Project , to apply the learnt concepts.

Final Aim : To Create a Java application for customer management system.
(signIn , signup, update password, un subsribe user ....)

2.1 Customer HAS-A 
customer id(int) ,first name, last name (string),email(string),password(string),registrationAmount(double),dob(LocalDate),plan(ServicePlan : enum)

ServicePlan charges : 
SILVER : 1000 
GOLD : 2000
DIAMOND : 5000
PLATINUM : 10000

Depending on the plan chosen , customer will have to pay specific registration amount

customer id should be system generated , using auto increment.

Unique ID(Primary Key ) : email  (2 customers are SAME iff their email ids are same)

After reading above , can you create a Customer class ?
Try it !

Happy weekend !

Day 3

Student queries : 
1.Still not clear about downcasting , classcast exc n instanceof checking!
Will be revised in today's lab.
Then you will understand equals method : completely!
Refer : Emp , Mgr ,Worker , SalesMgr,HRMgr,TempWorker,PermanentWorker 
We will develop this n understand .

2. import day4.2 
We will revise COMPLETELY showroom management system.
(You can add break points n test the flow of execution)

3. Will try to complete : atleast the Customer class
n some validation rules !(Time permitting)

4. Revise later (self study time)
import day4.1
4.1 revise enums
4.2 revise generics
